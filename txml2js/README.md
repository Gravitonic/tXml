# txml2js

placeholder, This might become a module for transforming the txml DOM into more usable structures, similar to xml2js or rapidx2j.

While reviewing and testing xml2js, I found, it behaves not good when determining if something has to be a list or a simple key. I need some more investigation to the right behavior of xml2js, when a key becomes an array and not.

### PRs are welcome ! ! !

The idea to implement txml2js comes from [issue 16](https://github.com/TobiasNickel/tXml/issues/16).

There are also described the requirements and some thoughts on implementation details.
