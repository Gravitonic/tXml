# tXml
a very small xml parser in pure javascript

This lib only provides one single method. The tXml() takes a string as input and parses its xml data into a dom object. 

1. this code is about 130 lines, can be easily extended 
2. this code is 550byte minified + gzipped
3. this code can running in a worker 
4. this code is parsing at avarage the same speed as native DOMParser

so, there are good reasons to give tXml.js a try.
